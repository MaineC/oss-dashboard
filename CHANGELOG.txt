This Changelog documents breaking changes, typically plugin API or database changes. 

2016-04-28: CHANGE: Changed the db_reporter API to include a context parameter. 
                    That is db_report(org, sync_db) became db_report(context, org, sync_db).
            REASON: This allows db reports access to the github_url context parameter, allowing them to work with private GitHub instances. 
            ACTION: Users should update any custom db-reporters to include the context parameter. 

2017-05-28: CHANGE: Removed two-factor-authentication from the synchronized data. 
                    This also removed the No2faDbReporter report.
            REASON: GitHub allows organizations to require two-factor authentication. Rather than looking at reports,
                    users should be enabling that feature. 
            ACTION: Users should remove the No2faDbReporter report from their config files. 

2017-05-28: CHANGE: Traffic tables added to the schema
            REASON: Traffic data is now being pulled from GitHub.
            ACTION: Existing users should manually add the traffic tables from db/schema.

2017-09-03: CHANGE: Overhaul of the dashboard approach.
                    The generate-dashboard/merge and generate-dashboard/teams-xml commands have been removed.
                    In their place are generate-dashboard/json-data and generate-dashboard/dashboards commands.
                    There is no longer a Teams drop-down, instead it is linked from the Teams page of the organization dashboard.
            REASON: To allow for custom charting and for custom dashboards, the dashboard approach has been changed 
                    to be repository focused. The system generates XML for each repository, then organizations and teams 
                    are the merger of a set of repository files. Additionally, the charting is moved out of the HTML files and 
                    into data and chart configuration JSON files. 
            ACTION: None usually needed; but recording here as it's a large change and users may have been dependent on side-effects.

2017-09-03: CHANGE: Change API of db-reports - now passes in the repo object, not the org.
                    Report XML files are now per repository. 
            REASON: With dashboards moving to a repo-focused approach, the db-reports needed to run on a repository and not 
                    an organization. 
            ACTION: Any custom db-reports will need to be modified to be repo-based.
