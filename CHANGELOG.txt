This Changelog documents breaking changes, typically plugin API or database changes. 

2016-04-28: CHANGE: Changed the db_reporter API to include a context parameter. 
                    That is db_report(org, sync_db) became db_report(context, org, sync_db).
            REASON: This allows db reports access to the github_url context parameter, allowing them to work with private GitHub instances. 
            ACTION: Users should update any custom db-reporters to include the context parameter. 

2017-05-28: CHANGE: Removed two-factor-authentication from the synchronized data. 
                    This also removed the No2faDbReporter report.
            REASON: GitHub allows organizations to require two-factor authentication. Rather than looking at reports,
                    users should be enabling that feature. 
            ACTION: Users should remove the No2faDbReporter report from their config files. 

2017-05-28: CHANGE: Traffic tables added to the schema
            REASON: Traffic data is now being pulled from GitHub.
            ACTION: Existing users should manually add the traffic tables from db/schema.
