# Customising your OSS Dashboard

There are three areas of customisation possible with oss-dashboard. The first two are plugging in your own reporting, the last is setting a custom theme for the web pages.

Note that the plan is to merge DB and Source reports into the same API. 

## Writing a DB Report

## Writing a Source Report

## Setting a Custom Theme

OSS Dashboard relies on Bootstrap, and thus Bootstrap Themes are available. The generated HTML pages include a __bootstrap-theme.css__ file if one is there (if not your browser will quietly give you a warning). Drop this file into your generated web directory and your theme will be applied. See the [Bootstrap Theme page](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/) for more information on finding/implementing themes.
